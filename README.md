# Game Concept and Mechanics
- Board: A hex grid where each hex produces resources (e.g., wood, stone, food) or serves as a territory.
- Players: 2–4 players take turns locally on the same device (local multiplayer).
- Resources: Players collect resources from hexes they control, based on a dice roll 
- Units: Players build and move armies to conquer hexes.
- Actions: Build structures (e.g., settlements), move armies, trade resources, or attack.
- Victory: Control a set number of hexes (e.g., 10) or eliminate opponents.

# Core Mechanics
- Turns: Sequential turns for each player.
- Resources: Roll a die (1–6) each turn; hexes with that number produce resources for their controller.
- Building: Spend resources to build settlements (cost: 2 wood, 1 stone) or armies (cost: 1 food, 1 wood).
- Combat: Compare army strength + a dice roll; winner takes the hex.
- Trading: Offer resources to other players during your turn.
